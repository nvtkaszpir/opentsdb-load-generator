# opentsdb-load-generator

## Overview

opentsdb-load-generator is a simple tool for load-testing Opentsdb.
It can generate and push large amount of data to the Opentsdb.
Currently, it uses `telnet` based put request

## Compile from source

```go
go get github.com/staticmukesh/opentsdb-load-generator
```

The `opentsdb-load-generator` binary should now be available at `$GOPATH/bin`/opentsdb-load-generator

## Usage

```bash
$ ./opentsdb-load-generator --help
Usage of ./opentsdb-load-generator:
  -conn int
    	Number of connection to Opentsdb (default 1)
  -metric string
    	Metric name to be send. (default "test.metric")
  -rate int
    	Number of data points per second to be send (default 1000)
  -tsdb string
    	Opentsdb server address (default "localhost:4242")
```

e.g. to push data at the rate of 10k datapoints per second on 10 connections, use the following command:

```bash
$ ./opentsdb-load-generator -conn=5 -rate=10000
2017/01/24 21:57:46 Conn No: 0, connected to localhost:4242
2017/01/24 21:57:46 Conn No: 2, connected to localhost:4242
2017/01/24 21:57:46 Conn No: 1, connected to localhost:4242
2017/01/24 21:57:46 Conn No: 4, connected to localhost:4242
2017/01/24 21:57:46 Conn No: 3, connected to localhost:4242
2017/01/24 21:57:47 Pushed 2000 data points in last 1 second on Conn: 1
2017/01/24 21:57:47 Pushed 2000 data points in last 1 second on Conn: 3
2017/01/24 21:57:47 Pushed 2000 data points in last 1 second on Conn: 0
2017/01/24 21:57:47 Pushed 2000 data points in last 1 second on Conn: 2
2017/01/24 21:57:47 Pushed 2000 data points in last 1 second on Conn: 4
```

## Kubernetes

See example `k8s/deployment.yaml`.
Adjust env vars, similiar to `Usage` section:

-  `CONN` - number of connections to opentsdb backend
-  `METRIC` - metric name, default is pod name
-  `RATE` - Number of data points per second to be send
-  `TSDB` - opentsdb service name

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl scale deployment opentsdb-load-generator --replicas 30
```
